# Adjustable-Series-Voltage-Regulator
Faculty Individual Project
<br>
<br>
Designed a series voltage regulator with an input voltage range of 41.4V to 46V and an adjustable output voltage between 11.5V and 23V.
<br>
Implemented overcurrent and thermal protection to enhance reliability, limiting the transistor's temperature to 100°C and the maximum current to 0.4A.
<br>
Created the PCB layout and soldered components for full circuit assembly.
