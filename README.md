# Adjustable-Series-Voltage-Regulator
Faculty Individual Project
<br>
<br>
Designed a series voltage regulator with an input voltage range of 41.4V to 46V and an adjustable output voltage between 11.5V and 23V.
<br>
Implemented overcurrent and thermal protection to enhance reliability, limiting the transistor's temperature to 100°C and the maximum current to 0.4A.
<br>
Created the PCB layout and soldered components for full circuit assembly.

## Conclusions

Testing was done at lower voltages than originally intended for safety and to avoid damaging the circuit.
<br>
The voltage regulator works well, although the output voltage does not fully comply with the specified range mainly because of the testing condition above.
<br>
An improvement would be to replace the series element's transistors with power transistors, as they dissipate the most power and are the most susceptible to failure in the event of a short circuit ensuring circuit reliability
